# Mission
The specific purposes of the Omo Valley Research Project is to advance scientific research, training, and education about the peoples and cultures of Southwest Ethiopia and to make charitable contributions to the health and education of the peoples of Southwest Ethiopia.
## Comparative & longitudinal research
We are creating new paths in interdisciplinary science by building a multi-population, longitudinal database designed to address outstanding questions in social and health science. Our methods integrate network analysis, remote sensing, experimental paradigms, participant observation, and ethnography. 
## Capacity Building & Support
We provide small grants and awards to students in the Omo Valley, many of whom would otherwise be unable to continue their education. We also support the training of future Ethiopian scholars through opportunities for participation in our research projects, mentorship of their projects, and involvement with local universities and research centers. As a research partner, we strive to foster long-term relationships with the communities we work with. By better understanding their lifeways and priorities, we work to be a meaningful ally in supporting their goals.
